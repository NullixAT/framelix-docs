title: Coding standards
---

We are working with strict coding standards and probably you should also when working with Framelix. It makes working together in modern times, where you do version control, so much easier.

## PHP
We try to keep the code confirm with [PSR1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)

## Javascript
We try to keep the code confirm with [StandardJs](https://standardjs.com/)

## CSS/SASS
We try to keep the code confirm with [Drupal CSS Standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards)
