So, Framelix has some basic core features.

* Full ORM (Object Relation Mapping) Database Handling - You probably never need to write a sql query by hand. You work with storable objects only.
* Model-View-Controller - Basically, you have a `View`, a page accessible by the browser, and you have a `Model`, a `Storable` which holds the data. Somewhere inbetween/mixed in there is the `Controller`, the business logic of your page
* Full-Stack - There is a full-featured backend UI with Form Generation, HTML Table Generation, and all the stuff you need to build a data driven application
* Modular - You can snap-in modules for extended functionality - Even the core itself is just threaded as a module
