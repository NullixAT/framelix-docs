title: Idea, motivation and philosophy of Framelix
---

It is good to know, what the general idea of a project is, how it has been created and where it should go.

So, myself, [BrainFooLong](https://github.com/brainfoolong), initial creator of Framelix, will try to explain you the details of this Framework.

I've created Framelix as a successor of some other PHP Full-Stack frameworks, which never went public and are used in closed company apps. I have, as of 2022, more than 15 years experience in web development, heavily focused on PHP in the backend and started working when `Internet Explorer 6` was a hot thing and `jQuery` wasn't even in the making.

Framelix was designed and created with 3 core principles in mind:
* Focus on productivity apps but let room for flexibility - Framelix was designed to act as a backend application to provide productivity tools where data matters but it has already been used for completely different stuff like [PageMyself](https://github.com/NullixAT/pagemyself)
* Make it most intuitive for devs - As a dev, you want a framework that can be used without learning hours of hours how to use it. This means short but good code documentation in the files, perfect auto-completion support that eliminate the need for just `knowing` things and strings, intuitive naming stuff (One char aliases and variable names are a no-no here)
* Keep it fast and slim - Not pack it full of things that almost nobody ever need - The core isn't big and won't ever be big - This requires thinking about features twice - Better split into a separate module that don't clutter the core

I've seen and used many frameworks in my career and i picked ideas of many of them and tried to combine them in a new framework.
